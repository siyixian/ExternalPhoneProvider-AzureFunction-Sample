# External Phone Provider Function — C# (.NET isolated worker)

Implements the shared [contract](../docs/CONTRACT.md) with one dispatch engine and one selected
provider per deployment. Target: .NET 8 isolated worker, Azure Functions v4.

## Setup and deployment

1. Follow [customer onboarding](../docs/ONBOARDING.md). Set `EPP_PROVIDER_NAME` to the selected
	adapter's registered manifest id (`<adapter-id>` is only a placeholder).
2. Consult the selected adapter and its manifest in [Src/Providers/](Src/Providers/) for required
	credentials and options. Store credentials in Key Vault under the declared secret names, grant
	the Function's managed identity *Key Vault Secrets User*, and configure the matching endpoint/options.
3. Base private local settings on [../docs/local.settings.sample.json](../docs/local.settings.sample.json),
	replacing placeholders and selecting `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME=dotnet-isolated`. Put settings
	at the app root beside [host.json](host.json). Configure decryption from the
	[shared catalog](../docs/CONTRACT.md#4-configuration-app-settings--env) and caller trust through
	[Easy Auth](../docs/ONBOARDING.md#2-provision-encryption-and-deployment-trust), the only authentication
	gate before the anonymous Function. Enable `requireAuthentication=true`,
	`unauthenticatedClientAction=Return401` and `requireHttps=true`; pin the trusted tenant issuer,
	endpoint-app `allowedAudiences` and a nonempty `allowedApplications` list for the authorized SAS
	caller. Do not exclude SendOtp. There is no backup application token validation; never expose the
	endpoint to the public internet with Easy Auth disabled or bypassed.
4. Build [dotnet.csproj](dotnet.csproj), run the offline xUnit suites in
	[tests/Epp.Otp.Tests.csproj](tests/Epp.Otp.Tests.csproj), and start the local Functions host from this folder.
	Core Tools has no Easy Auth: bind only to loopback, with no tunnels or public forwarding.
5. Publish this app folder to a compatible .NET isolated Function App. Inspect the package: both
	[.funcignore](.funcignore) and the project protect local settings; private keys must not be included.
	Offline tests cover application behavior, not platform authentication; run the separate
	[deployed security checks](../docs/ONBOARDING.md#4-package-deploy-and-verify).

## Environment configuration

Run Core Tools from `dotnet/`. Create an untracked `local.settings.json` beside
[host.json](host.json), starting from the [shared sample](../docs/local.settings.sample.json).
For local evaluation, start Azurite and replace the test-key placeholder in this minimal setup:

```json
{
	"IsEncrypted": false,
	"Values": {
		"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
		"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated",
		"EPP_DECRYPTION_KEY_PEM": "<base64 of your local test private PEM>"
	}
}
```

For live delivery, add `EPP_PROVIDER_NAME`, the complete selected `EPP_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`, and the
matching provider authentication settings to `Values`.
Add `EPP_PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME` and adapter-specific options only when required. Optional
`EPP_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS` is a string such as `"1500"`. Replace placeholders; store provider credentials
under the adapter manifest's Key Vault secret names, not in local settings. See the
[complete variable table](../README.md#configure-environment-variables).

Core Tools loads `Values` into environment variables. [AppConfig.Read](Src/AppConfig.cs) reads them
through `IEnv`; direct worker execution and unit tests do not automatically load local settings.
Restart the host after edits. Configure local host storage other than Azurite separately; do not copy
the emulator connection into Azure. Core Tools does not resolve Key Vault references locally; supply
the local test PEM or base64 PEM directly. The [project](dotnet.csproj) excludes private local settings
from publish output.

For Azure, configure the same application variables on the serving app/slot's **Environment variables
→ App settings** page and resolve the private PEM through a Key Vault reference. Key Vault provider
credentials use managed identity, not the developer's CLI login. Use loopback-only local evaluation
or the offline tests' injected environment and secret resolver for local development.

## Request behavior

`POST /api/SendOtp` uses the same request and trust boundaries as the other runtimes. Incoming
`mode`, `channel`, `ttlSeconds` and `tenantId` are request data, not deployment authentication settings.
Easy Auth authenticates and authorizes the caller before the anonymous handler validates the envelope
and decrypts the JWE. Incoming `Authorization` is not parsed or echoed by the handler. JWE does not
authenticate SAS: anyone with the public key can encrypt a request, and a fixed nonce is not authentication.

Use incoming `mode: 2` or `mode: "evaluation"` as the generic shutter for every provider: platform
authentication on Azure, handler validation and decryption run, but provider lookup, provider Key Vault
reads and provider HTTP do not. No provider configuration or diagnostic environment flag is required.
Live requests forward the rendered message unchanged using the configured provider's API key or OAuth token and
await acceptance before returning the nonce; failures omit it. Acceptance is not handset delivery.
Platform/key prerequisites and HTTP outcomes are defined in the
[contract](../docs/CONTRACT.md#evaluation-generic-shutter).
