# External Phone Provider Function — Python (v2 model)

Implements the shared [contract](../docs/CONTRACT.md) with one dispatch engine and one selected
provider per deployment. Target: Python 3.11, Azure Functions v4, Python v2 programming model.

## Setup and deployment

1. Follow [customer onboarding](../docs/ONBOARDING.md). Set `EPP_PROVIDER_NAME` to the selected
	adapter's registered manifest id (`<adapter-id>` is only a placeholder).
2. Consult the selected adapter and its manifest in [src/providers/](src/providers/) for required
	credentials and options. Store credentials in Key Vault under the declared secret names, grant
	the Function's managed identity *Key Vault Secrets User*, and configure the matching endpoint/options.
3. Base private local settings on [../docs/local.settings.sample.json](../docs/local.settings.sample.json),
	replacing placeholders and selecting `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME=python`. Put settings at the
	app root beside [host.json](host.json). Configure decryption from the
	[shared catalog](../docs/CONTRACT.md#4-configuration-app-settings--env) and caller trust through
	[Easy Auth](../docs/ONBOARDING.md#2-provision-encryption-and-deployment-trust), the only authentication
	gate before the anonymous Function. Enable `requireAuthentication=true`,
	`unauthenticatedClientAction=Return401` and `requireHttps=true`; pin the trusted tenant issuer,
	endpoint-app `allowedAudiences` and a nonempty `allowedApplications` list for the authorized SAS
	caller. Do not exclude SendOtp. There is no backup application token validation; never expose the
	endpoint to the public internet with Easy Auth disabled or bypassed.
4. Use a virtual environment, install [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and pytest, then run the
	offline [tests/](tests/) from this folder. Start the local Functions host from this app root.
	Core Tools has no Easy Auth: bind only to loopback, with no tunnels or public forwarding.
5. Publish this folder to a compatible Linux Python Function App with dependencies or a supported
	remote build. Inspect the package and apply [.funcignore](.funcignore); keep local settings and keys private.
	Offline tests cover application behavior, not platform authentication; run the separate
	[deployed security checks](../docs/ONBOARDING.md#4-package-deploy-and-verify).

## Environment configuration

Run Core Tools from `python/`. Create an untracked `local.settings.json` beside
[host.json](host.json), starting from the [shared sample](../docs/local.settings.sample.json).
For local evaluation, start Azurite and replace the test-key placeholder in this minimal setup:

```json
{
	"IsEncrypted": false,
	"Values": {
		"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
		"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
		"EPP_DECRYPTION_KEY_PEM": "<base64 of your local test private PEM>"
	}
}
```

For live delivery, add `EPP_PROVIDER_NAME`, the complete selected `EPP_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`, and the
matching provider authentication settings to `Values`.
Add `EPP_PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME` and any adapter-specific options only when required. Keep values as
strings, including optional `EPP_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS: "1500"`. Replace placeholders; provider API
keys belong in the manifest-named Key Vault secrets, not this file. See the
[complete variable table](../README.md#configure-environment-variables).

Core Tools loads `Values` into `os.environ`. Direct Python execution and pytest do not automatically
read local settings. [read_config](src/config.py) returns an `AppConfig` object; the handler/engine
use attributes such as `config.provider_name`, not dictionary key lookups. Restart the host after
settings change. Configure local host storage other than Azurite separately; do not copy the emulator
connection into Azure. Core Tools does not resolve Key Vault references locally; supply the local test
PEM or base64 PEM directly.

For Azure, set the same application variables on the serving app/slot's **Environment variables → App
settings** page. Use a Key Vault reference for the private PEM. Provider secrets require managed
identity, which is not supplied by a developer's CLI login. Use local evaluation or the mocked offline
tests on an ordinary workstation, and bind local hosts only to loopback.

## Request behavior

`POST /api/SendOtp` uses the same request and trust boundaries as the other runtimes. Incoming
`mode`, `channel`, `ttlSeconds` and `tenantId` are request data, not deployment authentication settings.
Easy Auth authenticates and authorizes the caller before the anonymous handler validates the envelope
and decrypts the JWE. Incoming `Authorization` is not parsed or echoed by the handler. JWE does not
authenticate SAS: anyone with the public key can encrypt a request, and a fixed nonce is not authentication.

Use incoming `mode: 2` or `mode: "evaluation"` as the generic shutter for every provider: platform
authentication on Azure, handler validation and decryption run, but provider lookup, provider Key Vault
reads and provider HTTP do not. No provider configuration or diagnostic environment flag is required.
Live requests forward the rendered message unchanged using the configured provider's API key or OAuth token and
await acceptance before returning the nonce; failures omit it. Acceptance is not handset delivery.
Platform/key prerequisites and HTTP outcomes are defined in the
[contract](../docs/CONTRACT.md#evaluation-generic-shutter).

## Source

| Source | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [function_app.py](function_app.py) | HTTP handler and adapter registration |
| [src/config.py](src/config.py) | Shared deployment settings |
| [src/models.py](src/models.py) | Envelope, delivery-context, dispatch and normalized `ParsedResponse` dataclasses |
| [src/dispatch.py](src/dispatch.py) | Boundary validation, JWE, provider registry and outcome mapping |
| [src/providers/](src/providers/) | Adapter manifests and API-specific implementations |
| [src/secrets.py](src/secrets.py) | Cached Key Vault access via managed identity |

Add and register an adapter without adding provider-specific branches to the shared pipeline.
Return `ParsedResponse` from `parse_response` using named fields; the engine reads attributes such as
`parsed.provider_status_name`. Raw provider JSON remains local to the adapter, not a shared model hierarchy.
See [production limitations](../docs/CONTRACT.md#production-limitations) before production use.
