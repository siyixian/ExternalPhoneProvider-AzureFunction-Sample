# External Phone Provider Function — Language-Agnostic Contract

This defines the shared contract for [JavaScript](../javascript/), [Python](../python/) and
[.NET](../dotnet/). See [production limitations](#production-limitations) before production use.

> **Naming.** EPP means **External Phone Provider**. App settings use the `EPP_` prefix; the
> request and delivery models are `Envelope`, `DeliveryContext` and `DispatchRequest`.
> Documentation names do not change the external JSON fields or `microsoft.mfa.otpDeliver.v1` version.

The design is **one dispatch engine + registered provider adapters**, with one selected provider per
deployment. API-specific paths, headers, payloads and status rules belong in adapters, not this guide.

---

## 1. HTTP API

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/SendOtp` (Functions HTTP trigger, `authLevel: anonymous`). **Easy Auth is the
only caller-authentication boundary and runs before the handler**; the application has no token
validator or function-key gate. This is the interface **SAS (StrongAuthenticationService)** calls.
SAS sends an Entra bearer JWT as part of its protocol; Easy Auth validates it, not the handler.
PII (phone number + the rendered message, which contains the passcode) is **encrypted** inside a JWE;
the cleartext envelope carries routing/scheduling only.

### Request headers

| Header | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `Authorization` | consumed by platform authentication, not parsed or echoed by handler |
| `User-Agent` | caller-supplied identifier; not interpreted or logged |
| `x-ms-correlation-id` | tracing only; fallback for envelope `correlationId`, not authentication |
| `x-ms-client-request-id` | per-attempt tracing id (used as `messageId`), not authentication |

Forwarded headers, including `x-ms-client-principal`, do not establish trust by themselves and cannot
replace the required Easy Auth gate. The handler does not use them to authenticate callers or forward
the incoming `Authorization` header to the provider. Configure Easy Auth as described in section 5.

### EPP request body — `Envelope` (cleartext envelope)

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `type` | yes | exactly `microsoft.mfa.otpDeliver.v1`; unknown versions are rejected |
| `tenantId` | no | opaque request routing metadata; never selects the trusted issuer, signing keys or provider |
| `correlationId` | no | sign-in tracing metadata |
| `channel` | yes | request delivery channel: `1`/`sms` or `2`/`voice`; not deployment configuration |
| `mode` | yes | request delivery mode: `1`/`live` or `2`/`evaluation`; evaluation does not deliver |
| `ttlSeconds` | no | positive JSON integer, at most `2147483647`; null, booleans, strings, fractions and nonpositive values are rejected. Use canonical integer notation (`60`, not `60.0` or `6e1`) across runtimes |
| `encryptedDeliveryContext` | yes | JWE compact serialization (see below) |

Canonical integer notation is a caller requirement, not a portable raw-JSON-token check: JavaScript's
JSON parser normalizes `60.0` and `6e1` to `60`, while Python/.NET reject those representations here.
Always send `60` to obtain the same result across runtimes; no custom JSON tokenizer is used.

Unknown `type`, invalid `ttlSeconds`, unsupported `channel` or `mode`, or missing/empty `encryptedDeliveryContext` → `400`. Arrays, objects and booleans are not channel/mode values.

These are request data, not settings to provision. The TTL check validates the supplied value; it
does not verify passcode expiry or implement a delivery deadline. Deployment trust comes only from
the required platform authentication and caller allowlist, not the body or tracing headers.

### `encryptedDeliveryContext` (JWE)

Alg: **RSA-OAEP-256** (CEK wrap) + **A256GCM** (content). The JOSE protected header carries `kid`;
this sample uses the single configured RSA private key (`EPP_DECRYPTION_KEY_PEM`, a Key Vault
reference in Azure), not a multi-key lookup. The compact JWE must have **exactly five non-empty
segments** and at most **16,384 characters**; `alg`/`enc` are pinned (only `RSA-OAEP-256` + `A256GCM` accepted) and the AES-GCM auth tag is
verified before any plaintext is used. Decrypted plaintext = `DeliveryContext`:

The original compact JWE is passed unchanged to the JOSE library. Parsing header fields for the
advisory key-ID check must not replace the original protected-header bytes used for authentication.

All three HTTP-handler suites use [shared policy cases](../tests/fixtures/contract.json): the allowed
pair succeeds, while `RSA-OAEP`, `A128GCM` and `A256CBC-HS512` alternatives return `400 decryption_failed`
without provider I/O. Decryption uses the same policy before live/evaluation branching, so the matrix
runs once per language. Tag tampering and original-header-byte tests remain.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `nonce` | yes | value the endpoint MUST echo to prove decryption |
| `phoneNumber` | yes | caller supplies an E.164 string; full E.164 validation is an implementation gap |
| `message` | yes | fully rendered, localized text containing the passcode; forward unchanged, including caller-supplied voice digit spacing. Do not extract, infer or guess a passcode |
| `extension` | no | office-voice contract field; not currently forwarded by the shared dispatch model |
| `locale` | no | voice selection input where supported by the selected adapter |
| `riskContext` | no | contextual request data; no risk-policy evaluation is implemented here |

Decryption failure → `400`. Missing `nonce` / `phoneNumber` / `message` → `400`.

JWE provides payload confidentiality and integrity, **not SAS caller authentication**. Anyone with the
public key can encrypt a request. The nonce acknowledges decryption; it is not an authentication
credential or replay protection, and a fixed nonce cannot substitute for Easy Auth.

### EPP response (JSON)

```json
{ "nonce": "<echo of request nonce>", "correlationId": "<echo>", "providerStatus": "accepted" }
```

`accepted`/`pending` are **not** failures (provider queued it; acceptance ≠ delivery to the handset).
The endpoint returns **`200`** on acceptance (any `2xx` counts as transport acceptance). On `2xx` **with a
matching nonce**, SAS treats the send as handled. **Nonce mismatch / non-2xx / timeout → SAS falls back
to native CAPP delivery.** `Evaluation` mode returns `200` + nonce echo without delivering.

Live handlers await provider acceptance; they do not launch background delivery after replying.
Handler failures omit the nonce and accepted status and return a sanitized error with a request ID
and, after envelope processing, a correlation ID. Platform rejections happen before the handler and
do not use this application response contract.

Validation failures return `error: "bad_request"` and a fixed `reason` in every language. Envelope
checks run in this order: object shape, version, encrypted-context presence, channel, mode, TTL.
Reasons are `invalid JSON body`, `invalid envelope`, `unsupported envelope type`,
`encryptedDeliveryContext is required`, `unsupported channel`, `unsupported mode`, `invalid ttlSeconds`
or `ttlSeconds expired`. A decrypted context missing a required nonblank string returns
`incomplete delivery context`. Reasons never include supplied values or exception text. JWE failures
return `error: "decryption_failed"` without a cryptographic reason or nonce.

### Evaluation (generic shutter)

The only shared non-delivery control is the existing incoming `mode: 2` or `mode: "evaluation"`,
for every provider and language. On Azure, Easy Auth still authenticates the caller before the
handler validates the envelope and decrypts the JWE with integrity checks. Provider lookup, provider
Key Vault reads and outbound provider HTTP are skipped. No provider name, endpoint or credentials
are needed. Platform authentication and resolution of the decryption-key reference may still require
network access. Core Tools has no Easy Auth; local evaluation must remain loopback-only, without tunnels.

There is no diagnostic environment flag. A live request is not an evaluation request. Adapter-specific
wire fields, where required by an API, remain internal and cannot enable a separate non-delivery mode.

---

## 2. Outcome → HTTP status mapping

The provider's parsed status is mapped via the adapter's `responseMapping` to an **outcome**, then to
an HTTP status. **Fail-closed:** an unknown/unmapped status is treated as `Fail`.
An unsuccessful provider HTTP response cannot become `Continue` because its body contains a
success-looking status. Explicit `Block`/`StepUp` outcomes remain non-success responses.

| Outcome | HTTP | When |
|---------|------|------|
| `Continue` | `200` | recognized success status |
| `Block` | `403` | provider says blocked |
| `StepUp` | `409` | provider signals step-up / fraud escalation |
| `Fail` | `429` | provider returned 429 |
| `Fail` | `401` | provider returned 401/403 (auth) |
| `Fail` | `400` | other provider 4xx |
| `Fail` | `502` | other provider error, or missing credential/endpoint |
| — | `504` | request to the provider timed out |
| — | `502` | network error to the provider (non-timeout) |

---

## 3. Provider adapter contract

Each provider is one unit exposing three things:

- **`manifest`** — protocol facts only:
  - `id` — provider id selected by `EPP_PROVIDER_NAME`; its complete request URL is `EPP_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT`
  - `auth` — either `{ mode: 'apiKey', keyVaultSecretName, identityKeyVaultSecretName? }` or
    `{ mode: 'oauth' }`; unsupported modes fail closed
  - `responseMapping` — map of provider status → `Continue` | `Fail` | `Block` | `StepUp` (+ `default`)
- **`buildRequest({ channel, endpoint, dispatch, credential, env })`** → `{ url, method, headers, body }`
- **`parseResponse({ httpStatus, ok, json })`** → `ParsedResponse`, containing `success`,
  `providerHttpStatus`, optional `providerMessageId`, `providerStatusName`, `providerStatusCode`
  and `providerStatusDescription` (snake_case attributes in Python, PascalCase in .NET).

The adapter reads its API-specific JSON and constructs a normalized `ParsedResponse` object:
[JavaScript](../javascript/src/functions/models.js), [Python](../python/src/models.py),
[.NET](../dotnet/Src/Models.cs). The engine reads named properties/attributes rather than provider JSON
or string-key response dictionaries. Optional values default to null/None; a status name takes precedence
over a code during outcome mapping, as before. Custom Python adapters must return `ParsedResponse`,
not the former dictionary.

This model is internal: do not serialize it into the endpoint response or log its fields. Public HTTP
responses still expose only the existing nonce/correlation/status or sanitized error contract.
Provider requests are serialized only when building the outbound HTTP body; incoming provider JSON
is parsed once and normalized inside its adapter. No serialization framework or provider-specific
class hierarchy is required.

Adapters require registration in the chosen runtime. Consult the selected adapter and its manifest
for required credentials and options: the manifest declares secret names and protocol mappings;
the implementation reads adapter-specific options from app settings. Do not duplicate individual
API contracts or credential catalogs in shared onboarding documentation.

## 4. Configuration (app settings / env)

Set by provisioning. **Identical names across all languages.**

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `EPP_PROVIDER_NAME` | registered id of the selected provider; `<adapter-id>` is a placeholder, not a bundled default |
| `EPP_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT` | complete absolute HTTPS request URL for the selected channel/region, with a hostname, port 1–65535, and no userinfo or fragment; redirects are not followed |
| `EPP_PROVIDER_CHANNEL` | optional configured `sms` or `voice` route; when set, other live-request channels fail closed |
| `EPP_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT_REGION` | selected `global` or `eu` route label; informational at runtime |
| `EPP_PROVIDER_AUTH_MODE` | must match the selected adapter (`apiKey` for Telesign, `oauth` for Soprano) |
| `EPP_PROVIDER_TENANT_ID`, `EPP_PROVIDER_SCOPE` | Soprano provider tenant and OAuth scope |
| `EPP_OUTBOUND_CLIENT_ID`, `EPP_OUTBOUND_MI_CLIENT_ID` | client application and user-assigned identity used for Soprano client-assertion exchange |
| `EPP_PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME` | sender/source only when required by the selected adapter |
| `EPP_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS` | trimmed ASCII decimal milliseconds; default 1500 for missing/invalid/nonpositive values; capped at 2500. Not a whole-invocation deadline |
| `EPP_DECRYPTION_KEY_PEM` | single RSA private key for JWE decryption, PEM or base64-encoded PEM; use a Key Vault secret reference in Azure, not a plaintext private key in shared settings |
| `EPP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID` | optional expected JWE `kid`; after successful decryption, a mismatch emits only `encryption_key_id_mismatch`. Advisory, not a key selector or authentication check |
| `KEY_VAULT_URL` | Key Vault URI for API-key providers |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | set for a user-assigned managed identity |

Provider credential values live in **Key Vault**, under the names in the selected adapter's manifest,
and are fetched via **managed identity** with the *Key Vault Secrets User* role. Do not put credential
values in code or app settings. No additional customer-private configuration or new environment
variable is needed for this guidance.

Caller trust is configured in **Easy Auth**, not application environment variables: pin the trusted
tenant issuer, the endpoint-app audience and the authorized SAS caller application ID. Incoming
`tenantId` is routing metadata and cannot select any of these. There is no application host-detection
guard or backup token validation. See [platform onboarding](ONBOARDING.md#2-provision-encryption-and-deployment-trust).

### Default provider and configuration readers

Provision `EPP_PROVIDER_NAME` with the customer's selected provider, plus the complete selected
channel/region `EPP_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT` and matching authentication settings. Telesign resolves its
API-key credentials from Key Vault. Soprano exchanges an outbound managed-identity assertion for a
token in the configured provider tenant/scope. A missing or unknown provider fails closed; there is
no implicit default or automatic failover. Request-body provider fields are not used.

The shared configuration readers are [JavaScript `readConfig`](../javascript/src/functions/config.js),
[Python `read_config`](../python/src/config.py), and [.NET `AppConfig.Read`](../dotnet/Src/AppConfig.cs).
They return named configuration objects for encryption and the selected provider, not caller-authentication
settings. Key Vault settings are read by JavaScript's configuration object and by the Python/.NET secret resolvers.
Provider-specific options remain ordinary app settings passed to the selected adapter.

JSON parsing and type checks stay at the request boundary. Downstream code uses `Envelope`,
`DeliveryContext` and `DispatchRequest` models (documented object shapes in JavaScript, dataclasses
in Python, and classes/records in .NET). Named .NET response records preserve the existing wire names
and optional-field omission. Object construction does not replace validation or coerce invalid input.

All customers call the same `POST /api/SendOtp` handler in their chosen language. Its registry selects
the configured adapter, which builds the provider's SMS or voice API call. Purchasing an unsupported
provider does not install an adapter: add and register that provider's adapter first. Purchase,
subscription activation and changing tenant policy belong to provisioning, not this Function.

## 5. Required behaviors

- **Fail-closed** — only `Continue` → `200 accepted`; unknown status → `Fail`.
- **Managed identity** — Key Vault access via managed identity only (user-assigned if `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
  set, else system-assigned). No static credentials.
- **Privacy** — never log phone numbers, passcodes, nonce values, bearer tokens, API keys, JWE headers/payloads,
  raw exceptions or provider responses. There is no plaintext diagnostic override. Each handler
  writes one summary with a generated request ID, the first 16 lowercase hex characters of the
  correlation ID's SHA256 hash, HTTP status,
  elapsed milliseconds and evaluation flag. Original wire correlation IDs and the required nonce
  echo remain unchanged. Hashes are pseudonymous, not anonymous; restrict log access and retention.
  A configured encryption-key-ID mismatch adds a fixed warning, never either key ID or the JWE header.
  Disable SDK, platform and proxy body tracing separately.
- **Platform authentication only** — enable Easy Auth with `requireAuthentication=true`,
  `unauthenticatedClientAction=Return401` and `requireHttps=true`. Configure the trusted tenant issuer
  and `allowedAudiences` for the endpoint app, plus a **nonempty `allowedApplications`** list pinned to
  the authorized SAS caller application ID. No excluded path may bypass authentication for SendOtp.
  The trigger remains `authLevel: anonymous`; there is no application token validation or function-key
  fallback. The platform rejects unauthenticated requests with `401` and denies callers outside the
  allowlist before the handler. **Never expose the endpoint to the public internet with Easy Auth off
  or bypassed.** Core Tools supplies no Easy Auth: local execution must bind only to loopback, with
  no tunnels or public forwarding. Neither request data, JWE decryption, a fixed nonce nor forwarded
  principal headers authenticate the SAS caller.
- **Timeout boundaries** — platform authentication and Key Vault retrieval happen outside the outbound HTTP
  timer. Python uses connect/read inactivity timeouts, not a hard elapsed-time deadline. The cap
  therefore does not guarantee a 3.2-second end-to-end response, especially on cold starts.
  A timed-out POST may already have been accepted; avoid blind retries that duplicate messages.

---

## 6. Lightweight tests

Each language keeps lightweight offline tests covering representative application checks for:

- Bundled adapter request formats and static provider credentials.
- Fail-closed outcomes, missing credentials, HTTPS guards and timeouts.
- Envelope validation and real JWE decryption/tamper rejection.
- Evaluation without provider I/O.
- Awaited delivery, nonce acknowledgement and privacy-safe logging.

The sample deliberately omits exhaustive input permutations and SDK internals. These tests use
local keys and mocked external services; they do not send SMS and **do not test Easy Auth or platform
authorization**. Separate deployed security tests are required for missing/invalid credentials,
wrong issuer or audience, unauthorized caller, HTTPS enforcement and SendOtp route protection.
An authorized evaluation must succeed without provider I/O. These checks do not replace provider
integration or handset-delivery checks. See [deployment verification](ONBOARDING.md#4-package-deploy-and-verify).

## Production limitations

This is a sample, not production certification. Successful provider acceptance and nonce checks do
not prove handset delivery or support for every provider feature.

- The Function imports one private PEM through a Key Vault secret reference and decrypts in-process;
  vault-resident cryptographic operations and overlapping key rotation are not implemented.
- The Preview 1 setup guide requires asynchronous delivery after acceptance. This sample still waits
  for the provider and has no durable queue or automatic retry implementation; it does not satisfy that
  timing architecture merely because the setup script deploys it.
- The outbound timeout is not an end-to-end deadline. Cold starts, platform authentication and Key
  Vault access can exceed the caller's budget; Python uses connect/read inactivity timeouts.
- Voice text is forwarded unchanged. Digit-by-digit rendering required by the setup guide must be
  verified for the chosen voice integration; unspaced numeric text is not guaranteed to be spoken correctly.
- Full body-size/content-type and E.164 validation, subscription provisioning, certification,
  least-cost routing and voice-callback workflows are outside this sample. Native fallback belongs
  to the caller, not this Function.

See [setup compatibility](ONBOARDING.md#setup-script-compatibility) for credential provisioning,
endpoint format and unsupported setup options.
